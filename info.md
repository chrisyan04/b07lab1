# b07lab1
This is a repo for the first lab assignment for B07 tutorials. We are writing source code in Java and compiling it, then interpreting with the use of an interpreter. The task is to get familiar with Java and Git. The prompt is based on the topic of polynomials.

Edit: Lab 2
- created separate arrays for coefficients and exponents of polynomials
- added methods saveToFile and multiply
- added the file constructor
- edited all other methods to operate with the newly created exponents array
